# Unbeatable (Friday Again Garfie Baby Port)
i was bored so i did this


many thanks to WizardMantis441 for giving me their unbeatable codename port
which i totally used as reference and didn't copy paste like 99% of the code from

## Stuff that isn't yet ported over
- The modcharting at the end of the song
  - This is gonna be a tricky one to do because the engine doesn't have a modchart system built in,
    and i can't just copy the one from Mario's Madness itself because sustains aren't segmented like in Psych.

    So i think i'll just hold off on this one for a little while :p
